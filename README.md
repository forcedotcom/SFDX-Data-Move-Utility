# ![SFDMU](src/images/logo.png)SFDMU - the Salesforce DX Data Move Utility

This SFDX Plugin will assist you to populate your org (scratch / dev / sandbox / prod) with data imported from another org. It supports all important insert / update / upsert / delete operations **also for multiple related sObjects**.

----

**You can now find [here](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SFDX-Data-Move-Utility-Desktop-App) the new desktop GUI application that will help you to manage the plugin configuration files and to run and monitor the migration process, that will make usage of this Plugin simple and convenient.**

----

* **New in version 2.6.0**  - Plugin will use for CRUD by default the <u>Salesforce Bulk Api v2.0</u> in Beta mode. 
  If you are experiencing any issue with the current v2.0 implementation, let us know. 
  You still can switch back to  the legacy Bulk Api v1.0 using the parameter bulkApiVersion = "1.0" of the script.
* **New in version 2.6.8** - Added support for the Bulk Query Api V1.0 for large data sets from 100000 records. Below this the standard REST Api will be used to query records. We plan to upgrade for supporting the modern Bulk Query Api V2.0 soon.
* **New in version 2.7.0** - Added support for Person accounts.

## Introduction

### Use case

Creating of a scratch org, dev org or even a sandbox today is a pretty fast and simple action. On the other hand the newly created organization has only metadata ready-to-use, has no real data that is always strongly required to develop and debug any Salesforce application. It makes no sense to manually create or load data traditional way(dataloader) for each new org because the data easily can be taken in whole or in part from  production or from the sandbox and imported into the new organization. 

In some cases we already have the data, but it's only required to modify particular records or even fields without touching others. When a date model is complex and contains a large number of dependencies, it becomes a very hard and annoying task. 

Also there is a situation when as client you would like to keep the data model clean without creating external ID fields in the SObject, therefore your goal is to find some workaround to update records in your developer org from the existing source without adding new fields. 

Population of the RecordtypeId field is another quite difficult task, when ids are not consistant between environment.

At current moment, there is no effective tool for both inserting and updating dependent objects based on any unique field used as External Id.  In most cases people use Excel spreadsheets to build source tables and try to mix between them to get proper values for the lookup or master-detail fields. So filling out even a small number of objects turns into a huge pain...

### The solution

**The SFDMU Plugin is suitable and convenient solution for the problem above.**

It provides easiest way to export data from multiple related sObjects between Salesforce orgs(even unlinked). Unlike other similar tools it can perform all important operations like <u>Insert</u> / <u>Update</u> / <u>Upsert</u> / Delete.

**<u>In addition this plugin has an amount  of very useful advantages,  for example:</u>**

- **It does not require a special ExternalId** **field for update / upsert** operations to bind related SObjects. Any field with unique values, such as a Name, can be used as External Id. The plugin internally compares the records from the source and target organizations based on the specified field and performs the necessary CRUD operations on the target.
- **Handles circular references between SObjects**, for example when Object1 has a child relationship to Object2, then the Object2 has a child relationship to Object3 and the Object3 has a parent relationship back to the Object1.
- **Supports data migration preserving Record Type** for each record.
- **Auto-number field, formula field and even multiple combined fields can be used as external ID.**
- **Handles** **self-referenced fields**, i.e Account.ParentId. 
- **Handles Person accounts.**
- **Supports**  **record** **owner assignment**. If the source and the target orgs have the same list of users it can assign each record to the owner with the same Name Owner.Name (User.Name) External Id key.
- **Supports** **export / import records to / from CSV files.**
- **Supports data masking** (mocking feature) during record insert / update.
- **Secured and safe**. All operations are performed on the client's machine, there is no cloud interaction, so all is completely safe.
- **User-friendly configuration.**  Configurable using simple JSON file.
- **Fast perfomance.**
- And more...





## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using this plugin you need to perform standard procedure of installing SFDX CLI on your local machine from  here:

```
https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_install_cli.htm
```



### Installing

<!--
There are two ways to install the SFDMU

1. Install as SFDX Plugin:
-->

```bash
# If you already have previous version of the Plugin installed on your local machine and want to update it, first uninstall the previous version:
$ sfdx plugins:uninstall sfdmu

# Install the latest version of the Plugin:
$ sfdx plugins:install sfdmu
```

<!-- 
2. Install from the git repository:

```bash
#If you already have previous version of the Plugin installed from the current git source, first you need to unlink (uninstall) it from the Salesforce CLI.

#1. Go to the directory contains the Plugin files and type:
$ sfdx plugins:unlink

#2. Update the files to the newest version.
$ git pull origin master

#3. Link the Plugin back to the Salesforce CLI: 
$ sfdx plugins:link


#If currently there is no Plugin installed on your machine, then skip previous steps and make as below.

#1. Clone git repository: 
$ git clone https://github.com/forcedotcom/SFDX-Data-Move-Utility

#2. Make this directory current:
$ cd sf-data-move-utility

#3. Install npm modules: 
$ npm install

#4. Link the Plugin to the Salesforce CLI: 
$ sfdx plugins:link

```
-->

<u>**Very important note! **</u>
**If you find that the Plugin version number has recently updated or have any issue with the Plugin functionality, first please <u>try to uninstall</u> previously installed version from your local SFDX CLI (see description above) and <u>install the Plugin again</u>. This will ensure that all necessary updates and dependencies are applied to your local plugin installation.**



## Command configuration

This Plugin is fully configurable with a json file called **export.json**.
By modifying it you can configure some export parameters and tell to the plugin which SObjects and which fields you want to process. 

##### Watch the demo. The Plugin in action.

Running the Plugin from the command console / terminal:

![SFDMU DEMO](https://img.youtube.com/vi/KI_1vD93prA/hqdefault.jpg)

( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KI_1vD93prA )



#### Minimal JSON file configuration.

Assume you have following SObjects with complex circular dependencies:

![diagram](src/images/diagram.jpg)

Let's say, that each SObject from the diagram above has unique Name value and you want to use Name as External Id field for all SObjects.

So you can export all records with preserving relationships between the objects using following basic format of  ***export.json***:

```json
{
    "objects": [
        {
            "query": "SELECT Id, Phone, TestObject3__c FROM Account WHERE Name LIKE 'TEST_ACC_%'",
            "operation": "Upsert",
            "externalId": "Name"
        },
        {
            "query": "SELECT Id, Account__c, TestObject3__c, RecordTypeId FROM TestObject__c",
            "operation": "Upsert",
            "externalId": "Name"
        },
        {
            "query": "SELECT Id, Account__c, TestObject__c FROM TestObject2__c",
            "operation": "Upsert",
            "externalId": "Name"
        },
        {
            "query": "SELECT Id, TestObject2__c FROM TestObject3__c",
            "operation": "Upsert",
            "externalId": "Name"
        }
    ]
}
```



If you want to utilize the org credentials that were previously stored in your system using *sfdx force:auth:web:login*  or another authentication sfdx command you can simply omit the *orgs* section from the script, then the Plugin will try to retrieve access token from the SFDX local storage.



#### Full list of the EXPORT.JSON parameters.

Of course the Plugin has also a huge amount of advanced features which give you great flexibility in setting up the data migration process. 

| Field                                | Data Type                  | Optional/Default        | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| orgs                                 | **Array (ScriptOrg**[])    | Optional / No default   | Credentials data of the Salesforce orgs you want to process.<br />It's optional parameter if need to configure manual connection to any of the processed orgs. <br />Alternatively you can force the Plugin to take SFDX connection from the stored in the local system. In this case simply omit the orgs section. |
| **ScriptOrg**.name                   | String                     | Mandatory               | Username to connect with.                                    |
| **ScriptOrg**.instanceUrl            | String                     | Mandatory               | Org instance url.                                            |
| **ScriptOrg**.accessToken            | String                     | Mandatory               | Access token to connect.                                     |
| pollingIntervalMs                    | Integer                    | Optional / Default 5000 | When used Bulk API this parameter defined the polling interval to check for the bulk job status. Decreasing this value may cause additional system load. |
| bulkThreshold                        | Integer                    | Optional / Default 200  | For better performance the plugin uses both Collection API for the small data and Bulk API for the large data processing. Collection API is a fast way to process, but it is always consuming a lot of the quota on API requests, so for large data sizes it's better to use Bulk API. This parameter defined the minimal size of data when need to switch from processing via Collection API to the Bulk API. |
| apiVersion                           | Float                      | Optional / Default 47.0 | API version number to use.                                   |
| objects                              | **Array (ScriptObject**[]) | Mandatory               | SObjects you want to process.                                |
| **ScriptObject**.query               | String                     | Mandatory               | SOQL query string. <br />Include in the query string all SObject's fields that you need to export, including referenced fields. It is enough only to list the fields and the plugin will automatically resolve and process all the references between  objects. Data from fields that are not listed in the query will not be exported.<br />Optionally you can filter the records by using WHERE, LIMIT, OFFSET etc. clauses. <br />*Nested queries and complex fields like Account__r.Name are not supported. But you still can use subquery in the WHERE clause for ex: .... WHERE Id IN (SELECT Id FROM .... )* |
| **ScriptObject**.deleteQuery         | String                     | Optional, Default none  | SOQL query string used to delete old records from the target org (see the "Delete" operator  and the "deleteOldData" parameter).<br />If this parameter is omitted - the same **ScriptObject.query** will be used to retrieve records both to delete and to update. |
| **ScriptObject**.operator            | String                     | Mandatory               | Operation that you want to perform with the current SObject.<br />**Available values are:**<br />**"Insert"** - creates new records on the target org even old versions of these records already exist.<br />**"Update"** - only updates existing records. The operator overrides all record fields.<br />**"Add"** -  creates a new record only if the old one does not exist.<br />**"Merge"** - like "Update", but does not override existing values, only fills empty record fields.<br />**"Upsert"** - Inserts new and updates old records, overriding all values.<br />**"Readonly"** - To say that you don't want to update this object, only to retrieve its records during the export. Useful in case that you need to include readonly SObject that is referenced from another SObject.<br />**"Delete"** - Only removes old target records from the given sObject. No update performed. |
| **ScriptObject**.externalId          | String                     | Mandatory               | External Id field for this SObject.<br />This is the unique identifier field, the field which can map any child records refering to this SObject. <br />Each field that has unique values across all records can be used as an External Id, even it's not marked as External Id within the SObject's metadata. You can also use standard External Id fields defined in the metadata.<br /><br />*This is used to compare source and target records as well as to process the relationships between objects during all operations, except of "Insert" and Readonly".* |
| **ScriptObject**.allRecords          | Boolean                    | Optional, Default true  | **True** value will tell to the Plugin to always process all records for this object  (but still in respect to the defined object's limitation).  For example if LIMIT 100 is defined - the  Plugin will process only 100 records.<br />**False** value will force the Plugin to apply an additional filter at run-time in order to determine and process the minimal sub-set of records, which is required for keeping relationships between objects. In this case even LIMIT 100 is defined - the Plugin might process another amount of records depend on the current situation. |
| **ScriptObject**.deleteOldData       | Boolean                    | Optional, Default false | Forces deletion of old target records before performing update. <br />*The difference from the "Delete" operator (see above) is that the "Delete" operator makes only deletion without updating the target environment.* |
| **ScriptObject**.updateWithMockData  | Boolean                    | Optional, default false | Enables data mocking for this SObject                        |
| **ScriptObject**.mockCSVData         | Boolean                    | Optional, default false | Enables export of data to CSV files with masked values instead of the original. |
| **ScriptObject**.targetRecordsFilter | String                     | Optional                | Additional SOQL query you can use to filter out unwanted  target data just before sending them to the Target.<br /><br />*Target data means the  records are directly provided in API request (Bulk API request or REST request) to update the target environment or to generate the target CSV file.* |
| **ScriptObject**.excluded            | Boolean                    | Optional, Default false | Set to true to exclude corresponding sObject from the migration process. <br /><br />*This parameter useful when you want to exclude certain sObject from the process leaving its definition in the export.json file.* |
| **ScriptObject**.useCSVValuesMapping | Boolean                    | Optional, Default false | When set to true and CSV files are used as data source - it enables changing the raw values from the CSV file according to the mapping table coming from the additional CSV file. Data will be loaded after the transformation is done (see details below). |
| **ScriptObject**.mockFields          | **Array (MockField[])**    |                         | Defines SObject fields that need to update with a fake data (see mocking feature below) |
| **MockField**.name                   | String                     | Mandatory               | The name of the field to mock (see mocking feature below)    |
| **MockField**.pattern                | String                     | Mandatory               | The pattern to create mock data for this field (see mocking feature below) |
| **MockField**.excludedRegex          | String                     | Optional                | The JS regex expression to **exclude** the values that **should not** be masked. |
| **MockField**.includedRegex          | String                     | Optional                | The JS regex expression to **include** the only values that **should** be masked. When defined -  other values are not matched the rule will not be masked. |
| promptOnMissingParentObjects         | Boolean                    | Optional, Default true  | If  parent lookup or master-detail record was not found for the some of the child records - it will propmt or will not prompt user to break or to continue the migration.<br /><br />*It allows user to monitor the job and abort it when some data is missing.* |
| allOrNone                            | Boolean                    | Optional, Default false | Abort job execution on any failed record or continue working anyway.<br />If true the execution will stop or the user will be prompted to stop depend on promptOnUpdateError parameter. <br /><br />*(**Note for REST API only:**  if true except of abort of script execution depend on promptOnUpdateError parameter - any failed records in a non-successful API call cause all changes made within this call to be rolled back. Record changes aren't committed unless all records are processed successfully)* |
| promptOnUpdateError                  | Boolean                    | Optional, Default true  | When some records failed or when any other error occurred during data update prompt the user to stop the execution or to continue. |
| encryptDataFiles                     | Boolean                    | Optional, Default false | Enables encryption / decryption of the CSV files when passing *--encryptkey* argument to the Plugin call and using *file* as Source or as the Target. |
| validateCSVFilesOnly                 | Boolean                    | Optional, Default false | In general when you are using CSV files as data source, the source CSV files are subject of format  validation before running the migration job itself.  validateCSVFilesOnly=true  runs only the validation process  and stops the execution after the it is completed. |
| createTargetCSVFiles                 | Boolean                    | Optional, Default false | If true the Plugin will produce CSV file containing target records for each processed sObject with error information (if occured) per record. These CSV files are not encrypted even **--encryptkey** flag is provided. |
| bulkApiV1BatchSize                   | Integer                    | Optional, Default 9500  | The maximal size of each batch while processing the records by the Bulk Api V1 |
| bulkApiVersion                       | Float                      | Optional, Default 2.0   | The version of Salesforce Bulk Api to use. Valid values are: 1.0 and 2.0 |
| importCSVFilesAsIs                   | Boolean                    | Optional, Default false | Sometimes you have source CSV files that are completely ready to be uploaded as is to the Target, which means that all values in these CSV files are correct (including search identifiers) and they don’t need additional verification or transformation. Typically, the standard Salesforce data loader uses this behavior, considering the CSV file ready to use. <br /> To import CSV files as is, set importCSVFilesAsIs = true <br /> Otherwise, before loading the plugin will make pre-processing of the data, which includes verification, processing relationships between the imported objects, etc. |



## Command execution

**Full sfdmu:run command syntax:**

```bash
$ sfdx sfdmu:run [-s <string>] [-p <directory>] [--encryptkey <string>] [--silent] [--version] [--filelog] [--noprompt] [--nowarnings] [-u <string>] [--apiversion <string>] [--verbose] [--concise] [--quiet] [--json] [--loglevel trace|debug|info|warn|error|fatal|TRACE|DEBUG|INFO|WARN|ERROR|FATAL]
```

**Available flags:**

| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| --sourceusername, -s [string] | The username/alias of the source salesforce org to take the data from it.<br />As mentioned above the credentials can be explicitly set in the [orgs] section of the export.json, or you can specify the username of the organization, that is previously connected using  standard sfdx force:auth:web:login command.<br /><br />**"--sourceusername csvfile"** will import records from previously created CSV files into the target Org.<br />The CSV files must exist in the same directory as the export.json file.<br />Use *--targetusername csvfile* parameter (see below) to create these files from the source records. |
| --targetusername, -u [string] | The username/alias of the target salesforce org where to put the data.<br /><br />**--targetusername csvfile** will export records from the source org into CSV files. Each SObject will be stored in separated file. |
| --path, -p [directory]        | [Optional] Absolute or relative path to the directory that contains working export.json file. If not provided, the plugin will try to search for the file in the current directory. |
| --quiet                       | [Optional] Disable logging - show only success/errors. Supress stdout output. if --filelog is specified the plugin will still log into file. |
| --silent                      | [Optional] The same as --quiet flag. Disable logging - show only success/errors. Supress stdout output. if --filelog is specified the plugin will still log into file. |
| --apiversion [float]          | [Optional] If specified overrides apiVersion parameter of the export.json file. Used for all api requests made by this command. Example value: 47.0 |
| --concise                     | [Optional] Display only short messages, that are highly important for understanding the progress of the execution. |
| --filelog                     | [Optional] In addition stdout/stderr this flag will turn on logging into .log file. Each command run will create separated log file inside /log subdirectory related to the with the working export.json file. A verbosity control is disabled for log files: all messages will be logged, even --quite flag was specified. <br />By default file logging is disabled. |
| --json                        | [Optional] Return formatted json instead of text to stdout as a result of the command execution. <br />Json result will also contain extended information as start time, end time, time elapsed etc. |
| --nopromp                     | [Optional] Flag to skip all prompting for more inputs or confirmation. Command will continue using the default options. |
| --nowarnings                  | [Optional] Flag to supress output of all warning messages to stdout. |
| --verbose                     | [Optional] Display all command messages and errors.          |
| --version                     | [Optional] Display the current installed version of the plugin. |
| --loglevel                    | [Optional, default: warn] logging level for this command invocation. |
| --encryptkey                  | [Optional] The encryption key to decrypt the **orgs** section of the export.json file.  <br />Please note, that when it is specified in the command line you need to have orgs section previously encrypted with the same encryption key before running the job (or alternatively  leave empty or omit **orgs** section).<br />The Plugin will attempt to decrypt the  **org.name**, **org.accessToken** and **org.instanceUrl** parameters using AEC-CBC algorithm before making the connection.  If for any reason the decryption failed, original unencrypted values will be used to connect.<br /><br />In addition if you set the parameter **encryptDataFiles=true** and use CSV files as data source then the Plugin will treat CSV files as previously encrypted and will try to decrypt them using the same key.  Also the Plugin will encrypt CSV files when using CSV files as a data target. |

**Basic examples:**

Use following console command to start the export from one Org to another:

```bash
$ sfdx sfdmu:run --sourceusername source@name.com --targetusername target@name.com
```


To import from the CSV files use the format as below:

```bash
$ sfdx sfdmu:run --sourceusername csvfile --targetusername target@name.com
```


To export records into CSV files use the format as below:

```bash
$ sfdx sfdmu:run --sourceusername source@name.com --targetusername csvfile
```


To export records into CSV files with encryption use the format as below:

```bash
$ sfdx sfdmu:run --sourceusername source@name.com --targetusername csvfile --encryptkey myencrkey
```



## Advanced features

#### Combined External Id keys feature.

This is useful feature that allows you to bind source and target records by creating "virtual" external Id field which is a combination of multiple field values. For example, there is Description object that has two parent objects called Article and Language and there is no unique field defined in Description object.
Each Article has several Descriptions with different Languages. Each Language and Article have unique Names. 
Assume you want to execute Upsert operation on the Description object.  In this case you cannot bind Description records directly, you only can bind them via their both parents objects. So you can define the Description object in the script like this:


```json
  objects: [
      { ... },
      { ... },
      {
          "query": "SELECT Id, Name, Article__c, Language__c FROM Description__c",
          "operation": "Upsert",
          "externalId": "Article__r.Name;Language__r.Name"
      }
  ]
```

During the data migration process the Plugin will internally generate a "virtual formula field" (since there is not such a real field in the Description object metadata) value that is combination of Article.Name and Language.Name values and will use it for binding the records.

You can use here unlimited number of fields separated by semicolon.




#### Data mocking feature.

If you're developing an application, you'll want to make sure you're testing it under conditions that closely simulate a production environment. In production, you'll probably have a sensitive data that usually you do not want to expose in the testing environment. To help with this use case I have added the option to mask real record value with a fake one before uploading it to the target.

You can define the list of fields that their values need to be replaced with the fake data and the pattern for each field under **mockFields** section of SObject.

Below is the example of script that will generate a sequence of random fake names instead of the original Name values  before the records will be inserted into the target org.
```json
  objects: [
      { ... },
      { ... },
      {
          
          "query": "SELECT Id, Name FROM Account",
          "operation": "Insert",
          "externalId": "Name",
          
          "mockFields": [
                {
                    "name": "Name",
                    "pattern": "name",
                    "excludedRegex": "^DummyAccount$",
                    "includedRegex": "Account\\sTo\\Mask"
                }
          ]    
      }
  ]
```


This will skip the original account names and produce Accounts records like this:

```json
  [
      {
          "Id" : "[RECORD ID1]",
          "Name" : "Miss Perry Larson",
      }, 
      {
          "Id" : "[RECORD ID2]",
          "Name" : "Ms. Alec Romaguera",
      },
      
      {
          "Id" : "[RECORD ID3]",
          "Name" : "Ms. Alec Romaguera",
      },
      
      {
          "Id" : "[RECORD ID4]",
          "Name" : "Ms. Drake Gerlach"          
      },
      ...
  ]
```

Add "--row" flag to the excludedRegex or includedRegex expression (**f.ex "excludedRegex": "^DummyAccount$ --row"**) to skip checking other values and to exclude entire row on to include it if the current match is true.


You can find complete list of available patterns [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/casual#embedded-generators )

For the "pattern", omit the "casual." prefix leaving only the name of the function, for example, you can write:   *"name", city", "street", "address"* etc.

Also you can use additional patterns that are not in the list above:

1) **ids** - updates given field with the original source Record Id value.

2) **c_seq_number(prefix, from, step)**  - produces sequence of strings terminated by number starting from the number defined by the "from" parameter incremented by the "step".

For example,    ***c_seq_number('TheRecord  ', 1, 2)***    will produce strings 
*"TheRecord 1", "TheRecord 3", "TheRecord 5", .....*

3) **c_seq_date**(from, step) - produces sequence of dates from the "from" date with defined "step".

For example:  ***c_seq_date('2019-01-01', 'd')***   will generate dates 
*"2019-01-01", "2019-01-02", "2019-01-03"*

Available values for the step parameter are:

**"d" :**      + one day

**"-d" :**      - one day

**"d0" :**      the same date as "from" without increment / decrement

**"m" :**      + one month

**"-m" :**      - one month

**"y" :**      + one year

**"-y"** :      - one year

**"s" :**      + one second

**"-s" :**      - one second

**"ms" :**      + one millisecond

**"-ms" :**      - one millisecond





#### Automatic CSV source transformation feature.

In some cases we get a source CSV file that could not be loaded directly into the target Org, because it contains raw data that need to be transformed into uploadable format prior the actual upload. 

For example, our CSV file contains picklist translated labels instead of their values, so we have to replace labels with values in order to construct well formatted source CSV.

The Plugin provides useful feature for automatic replacement of CSV values before upload.
It is optional feature that can be enabled for certain sobject by setting the parameter **useCSVValuesMapping** to **true**. 

The value replacement is being performed according to the mapping table stored in the CSV file **ValueMapping.csv**.  Put this file in the same directory as the export.json file.
The file should contain 4 predefined columns:

| ObjectName                                     | FieldName                                     | RawValue                                                     | Value                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| *The sObject api name to map, f.ex*.  **Case** | *The field api name to map, f.ex.* **Reason** | *The value in the source CSV file, f.ex. translated label*  **Вопрос** | *The value that should be uploaded to the target instead of the provided RawValue, f.ex.* **Question** |



This single file provides mapping table for all sObjects and fields included in the current migration package, that they should be transformed before actual loading. 

Only raw values that found in the mapping table will be replaced, but the rest  of CSV values remains unchanged.

Use **#N/A** *RawValue* to map an empty source record to another *Value*.



#### Reports and logs.

The plugin provides a variety of information about common warnings and errors that were found at runtime. All report files are put into the same folder as the corresponding export.json file.

- The Issues regarding source CSV files are in the **CSVIssuesReport.csv** file.
- The issues regarding missing parent lookup records are in the **MissingParentRecordsReport.csv** file.
- While each running of the migration process when --filelog flag is specified the Plugin creates dedicated log file that can be found in the **logs/** subdirectory. This log file mirrors the console/terminal output and allow you to review it.
  




## Notes

* You can use record Id field and autonumber fields as external Id key for Insert operation.
  You can still have external Id field of formula type for all operations including Upsert.


* By default the owner of new record is the user under which you are running the data migration.
  In order to make different record owner assignment you simply need to add **OwnerId** field to the SObject's query.  This will tell to the plugin to assign the target record to the user with the same Name as in the source. To get this feature work you must ensure that you have users with the same Names in the both Orgs.
  
* If you want to export record by preserving RecordType just include RecordTypeId field in the query and the plugin will do the rest. 

* If you have previously exported source data into CSV files and then want to import it from the files into another Org you need to use export.json file that has the same configuration like when you have created the CSVs.

* Note about the targetRecordsFilter parameter. 
  The targetRecordsFilter uses regular SOQL syntax, but with one exception: for ex. when you want to select only records with field ParentId != null, you must write in  "ParentId" instead of "ParentId != null".
  In opposite if you want to select records with ParentId = null you just write "NOT ParentId" instead of "ParentId = null".
  
* The file Import / Export feature supports standard Salesforce Data Loader file format. 
  So in most cases you can use CSV file previously generated by the data loader or use the Data Loader to upload files generated by the Plugin.
  
* Migration of User object currently is NOT supported.
